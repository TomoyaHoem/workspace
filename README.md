## Intro

### Generative Models for Molecular Discovery using Evolutionary computation and Deep Learning:
The discovery of novel molecules is essential to the development of new drugs. Traditional molecular design involves using human expertise to propose, synthesize, and test new molecules, but this process can be costly and time-consuming and limits the number of molecules that can be reasonably tested. Generative modeling offers an alternative approach to molecular exploration by recasting molecular design as an inverse design problem. In this study, we propose a method for molecular design using Evolutionary Computation and Deep Learning.
